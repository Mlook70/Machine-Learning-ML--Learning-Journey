# ML-Learning-Journey

This repository contains various projects and scripts developed during my journey of learning Machine Learning (ML). It covers fundamental concepts such as data analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning, and Python programming with popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. `Data`
This folder contains CSV datasets used for analysis and training machine learning models. The datasets include:
- `cancer_data.csv`
- `diabetes.csv`
- `Mall_Customers.csv`
- `data_cleaning.csv`

### 2. `Data_Analysis`
Contains scripts that demonstrate data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib:
- `cleaning.py`: Data cleaning process.
- `pandas01.py` to `pandas08.py`: Various data manipulation and analysis techniques with Pandas.
- `matplotlib01.py` to `matplotlib04.py`: Visualizations using Matplotlib.
- `seaborn.py`: Visualizations using Seaborn.

### 3. `Supervised`
This folder includes Python scripts demonstrating supervised learning techniques:
- `classification.py`: Example of classification algorithm implementation.
- `knn.py`: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm implementation.
- `linear_Regression.py`: Linear regression model.

### 4. `Unsupervised`
Contains unsupervised learning techniques:
- `k_means.py`: K-Means clustering algorithm.
- `KMeans_cancer.py`: Application of K-Means clustering on a cancer dataset.

## How to Run
